> trollbot based on an actual user

## install
Add a .config.json file containing your client ID in the following format:
```json
{
	"client": "{Client ID}"
}
```
You can get a key by going to the ["my apps"](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) page, logging in, and clicking on the "New App" button. After setting up the app you should be able to see the client ID you can use, you will still need to create a bot for the App.

A profile picture and name should be set while setting up the bot, I've included the picture the user was using in the assets folder.

## usage
As of writing only replies to any DM with "Yes!", like the actual user.

## tests
No tests are implemented yet.
